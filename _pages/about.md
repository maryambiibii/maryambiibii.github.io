Hi, I’m Maryam. I earned BS and MS degree in computer science from COMSATS university Islamabad.

My research interest lies in multilingual models that can learn relatability between languages and make more efficient generalization, by studying the typology of languages.

I am self-taught data scientist. I also love building static and dynamic websites.
